"I'm an IT enthusiast! My journey started when I pursued my interest in the field of Informatics during college. 
As a passionate and results-oriented IT enthusiast, this allowed me the opportunity to gain experience working 
in the Information Technology industry for 2+ years as a Website Maintainer, Network Engineer, and CTF Problem Setter. 
With a passion for coding and effective communication, I play an important role in developing and maintaining company websites. 
I am also actively involved in the cybersecurity community, having been a finalist in Hackfest0x05 and played a crucial role 
as a member and CTF problem setter in Hackfest0x06, Technofair 10.0, and Hackfest0x07 recently. 
Additionally, I engage with the Cyber Community Universitas Gunadarma and build meaningful relationships with stakeholders."
