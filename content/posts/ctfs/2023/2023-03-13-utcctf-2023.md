We need the symbol table for the corresponding kernel.

```bash {title="bash"}
$ ls
debian11.core  debian11.core.zst  debian11_5.10.0-21.json  debian11_5.10.0-21.json.zst
```

As the symbol table in the form of a JSON file is already provided in this challenge, we can simply move it to the directory `/volatility3/symbols`.

```bash {title="bash"}
$ mv debian11_5.10.0-21.json /home/nopedawn/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/volatility3/symbols
```

Then, we can continue recover the bash command history from memory.

```bash {title="bash"}
$ vol -f debian11.core linux.bash

### A Network Problem - Part 1

We can establish a network connection by using netcat then sending data through that connection. In this context, the command will establish a connection to the host `betta.utctf.live` on port `8080`, which is a server or service that can receive connections to perform certain network interactions.

```bash {title="bash"}
$ nc betta.utctf.live 8080
Hi Wade! I am using socat to broadcast this message. Pretty nifty right? --jwalker utflag{meh-netcats-cooler}
```

After the connection is successfully established, we will receive response data from the host in the form of text and also a flag.

We can use the command `enum4linux -a betta.utctf.live` to run the enum4linux program in the terminal and perform enumeration on the host betta.utctf.live.

`enum4linux` is a tool used to examine Windows and Samba systems in order to search for information about users, user lists, group information, security policy information, and information about running services. In this context, the command will attempt to perform enumeration on the `betta.utctf.live` host with the `-a` option that allows searching for more detailed information, such as searching for Samba shares, user information, and other information.

In general, the enum4linux program is used to scan and gather information on systems connected to a network in order to evaluate the security of those systems, including searching for potential vulnerabilities and security holes that attackers can exploit.

```bash {title="bash"}
$ enum4linux -a betta.utctf.live

We have discovered SMB share `WorkShares`. It will useful for us to find more files we can work with.

Letâ€™s enumerate SMB using `smbclient` tool. Upon password prompt hit Enter and we will be logged in `WorkShares` smb share.

```bash {title="bash"}
$ smbclient //betta.utctf.live/WorkShares

I don't understand the fasination with the magic phrase "abracadabra", but too many people are using them as passwords. Crystal Ball, Wade Coldwater, Jay Walker, and Holly Wood all basically have the same password. Can you please reach out to them and get them to change thier passwords or at least get them append a special character?

### Reading List

  <summary>Description</summary>
  
  > I created this binary to keep track of some strings that I want to read. I thought I put a CTF flag in it so I'll remember to make a problem for UTCTF, but I can't seem to find it...

The command `strings readingList | grep "utflag"` is used to extract strings from the binary elf file [readingList](https://github.com/nopedawn/CTF/blob/main/UTCTF23/Reading_List/readingList), then search for strings that contain the keyword `"utflag"` in the resulting string output.

```bash {title="bash"}
$ strings readingList | grep "utflag"
utflag{string_theory_is_a_cosmological_theory_based_on_the_existence_of_cosmic_strings}
```

`strings` is a command used to extract and print sequences of characters that are readable as strings from a given file input. In this case, `readingList` is the file from which the strings will be extracted.
